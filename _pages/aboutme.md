### About me

I was born in Zaragoza, where I studied a dual bachelor in Law and Business Administration. After working in consultancy for some months, I started a research master in Sociology and Demography from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the University Carlos III of Madrid,  affiliated to the Department of Social Sciences. As I wrote in endless motivation letters, my educational background has provided me an excellent cross-cutting understanding of the social sciences and analytical tools for analysing economic, social, legal and administrative relations and their intersections in global societies.
However, my academic career was a fortunate accident.

Research was not my first choice. In fact, it was not even an option. Taking up the double degree in law and business administration was a way for me to secure a professional career in the private sector given the pessimistic outlook during the worst of the Great Recession. Consequently, the gap between what I saw as a forced obligation and mi personal interests deepened until my first Bachelor's thesis. It was the first moment I came into contact with research and it showed me a new way to combine my studies and my passions. Encouraged by the grades of my two bachelor theses and the advice of my supervisors, I decided to enrol in a research master's in sociology and demography. The reason? More than my love for Weber or Merton was the fact that this master one of the few research Master's programmes available at the time of my application.

So a series of fortunate circumstances brought me to sociology, that strange place where everyone is welcome because nothing human is alien. I guess it was an instant crush. Sociology, or at least the sociology that I loved, is the art of understanding what we aspire to, the structure of (perceived) opportunities and constraints, and the (usually unintended) consequences of our actions. And as is only the case with good lovers, it made me change my trajectory. I became aware of my privileges and disadvantages, my relative position within the social structure and the fact that the engine of change never stands still. But knowledge also has something to do with duty. As a member of a generation that has been told to make crucial decisions in the face of  the bleakest scenario, understanding this process is not just an intellectual desire, but a moral obligation.

However, this is not the only reason to be a researcher. There are many reasons to pursue an academic career, but they all boil down to one: Research is only recommended for researchers. Beyond the tautology, there is a truth behind it: It is a long and hard road, and it is only worth it if it is your passion. Like a shipwrecked poet writing in the sand what will be erased tomorrow, 
I truly believe that I will always wonder about the world I belong in and try to unravel its social dynamics, to understand who we are and who we can be.
