About me
======

Hi!
I am José David López Blanco, a PhD student in Sociology at the University Carlos III (Madrid, Spain), affiliated to the Department of Social Sciences. 
I am a quantitative sociologist with interests in migration and ethnic relations. In my thesis "Beyond the dichotomy: Reframing Internal and International Migrations", my aim is to bridge the traditional division between both categories of migrations as two different, and practically isolated, bodies of research. I am also interested in demographic topics such as fertility intentions and comparative sociological studies in southern European countries.
Here you can see information about my research and my biography.

If you work on similar topics or are interested in my work, please do get in touch via email (jolopezb@clio.uc3m.es).
