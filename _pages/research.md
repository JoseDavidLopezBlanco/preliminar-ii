Research
======
I am broadly interested in migration and ethnic relations: how the interplay between individual and contextual factors shape migration decisions, and how their integration differs according to the context of destination and resources embedded within ethnic ties.

 

I am part of the research network  [GEPS](https://www.geps.es/) (Grupo de Estudios de Población y Sociedad). 

Besides migration, I am also interested in economic sociology and demographic phenomena.

## López Blanco, J.D. Language and Migration. An Analysis of Linguistic Capital in Internal and International Migration.

Language skills have been shown to be a key element in migration decisions. Given the multifaceted
nature of language as a productivity enhancer, status marker, and ethnic boundary, the literature has
traditionally examined the various mechanisms through which language influences migration under
the theoretical frameworks of human capital, cultural capital, and social capital. However, the
simultaneity and interaction of these dimensions is rarely explored. In this paper, I propose the
concept of linguistic capital as a comprehensive theoretical model that explains the relationship
between language and mobility. Using data from Spain, I compare the effects of language proficiency
between bilingual minority native speakers and monolingual native speakers as an example of
individuals with a larger language repertoire without motivational selectivity. The results suggest that
language gives bilinguals an advantage in their multilingual economy. As a result, bilinguals are less
likely to move away from their language boundary than monolinguals, except for migration to areas
with the same language policy. Finally, the results suggest that bilingualism influences migration by
making it easier to acquire a third language due to the decreasing cost of acquiring new languages.

## López Blanco, J.D. Internal and International Migration in “Schengenland”.Determinants of graduate migration from
Italy and Spain
<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>
The study of the links between internal and international migration has traditionally been neglected in
migration research. This gap is even more striking in the case of the countries of the European Union, as the
policy of free movement and the creation of a common labour market have placed intra-European mobility in a
liminal state: neither an unlimited space of free movement nor a classic example of cross-border restrictions. With
the aim of filling this gap, this paper addresses the question of whether - and how - intra-European migration
differs from intra-European migration in terms of migration selectivity and economic performance. It does so by
examining the attraction of graduate migration to internal and international economic ’cores’, using comparable
micro-level survey data from a representative sample of Italian and Spanish graduates. The findings confirm
that intra-EU migration remains a costly project, requiring greater scale and diversity of resources than internal
migration. They also show that the nature of each resource influences migration decisions, as the extent to
which resources are location-specific and their transferability determine which migration path is chosen. Finally,
the results also highlight the important role of regional development and economic/non-economic factors in
determining selectivity between internal and international migration. Thus, internal and international migration
can act as a factor in the reproduction of social and spatial inequality.

## Espadafor, M. & Passaretta, G. Does family socioeconomic status compensate for an early entry into school life? Evidence from Germany, with Giampiero Passaretta. 
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Previous literature shows that children who enter school at a younger age under perform compared to older classmates throughout school and adulthood.In this article, we analyse whether families differently react towards younger-for-grade children and when differences across family socioeconomic status (SES) in school entry age emerge. We contribute to the literature by providing an analytical example of one channel that could contribute to inequality in learning and achievement.
Using the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and a novel research design, we estimate the effect of school entry age on various cognitive domains throughout primary education and in the transition to academic secondary school. First, we find that an early school entry age leads to lower cognitive abilities. Unlike previous studies, these effects are equal across family origins: high-SES families do not engage in remediation strategies for younger than grade students. However, by the time students reach the transition to secondary school, only low-SES younger than grade children have a lower likelihood to be recommended to the academic track.
Overall, our results suggest that while high SES families do not react towards a disadvantage in terms of performance, they do in terms of expected attainment. These findings challenge the compensatory advantage hypothesis, by which children from high SES families are less on prior negative outcomes.
